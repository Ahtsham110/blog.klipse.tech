Computer Programming is to let the computer know what we want it to execute.

Computer understands only a special language. When you want to communicate with your friends, you use human languages like english, french or spanish. When you want to communicate with a computer you use computer languages like ruby, python or clojure. All of them are examples of computer programming languages.

Enough introduction, let's start to do some real programming.

# Your first program

Let's imagine you don't remember your table of multiplications and you want the computer to calculate `2*3` for you. How are you going to do that?

Well first, you need to tell the computer that you want him to execute something. For that you use the parenthesis: `()`. The computer will execute for you the content of the parenthesis.

Then, you need to tell him what `operations` you want him to execute: in our case, the operation is the multiplication. The symbol for multiplication is: `*`.

Finally, you need to tell him what are the details of the operations. We call them the `operands`. In our case, the `operands` are `2` and `3`. The operands must be separated by one or more white spaces.

Combining all of that, we get:

(* 2 3)

Now, modify the `operands` above and try to replace `2` and `3` by `4` and `5`.

What happened?

Did you get `20`?


Now, try to add more `operands`: for instance you could type `(* 2 3 4 6 8 2 3)`.

Try to add more white spaces between the operands, or between an operand and a parenthesis.

What results do you get?

# Exercices
