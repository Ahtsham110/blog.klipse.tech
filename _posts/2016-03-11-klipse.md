### What is KLIPSE?

[KLIPSE][app-url] is a clojurescript evaluator that shows you 3 things about a cljs expression:

1. the result of its evaluation as a clojure object
2. its generated javascript code
3. the result of its evaluation as a js object

### Why we are passionate about KLIPSE?

[KLIPSE][app-url] allows you to understand better how clojure and clojurescript works.
You can play with it and use it a (very simplistic) REPL.
But the real value of KLIPSE is that it shows you what happens behind the scene, what is the magic that allows LISP to be available in the browser as it was envisioned by [Brendan_Eich][brendan-eich-url] to *"put scheme in the  browser"*.
Making it simple and easy to look, observe and admire the js generated code by cljs is really a source of bliss for us the cljs developers.

The trigger for developing KLIPSE was [this discussion][discussion-url] were Shaun Lebron shade a lot of light with his [gist][gist-url] that demonstrates the behaviour of `extend-type` for cljs objects, js objects and js base types (e.g. "function", "number", "array").

So go ahead give it a try in KLIPSE and execute Shaun's code:

~~~ clojure
(defprotocol IFoo
(foo [this]))

;; dummy cljs type
(deftype Bar [])

;; extending a cljs type
(extend-type Bar
IFoo (foo [this] (println "Hello from IFoo.foo for Bar")))

;; extending a js type
(extend-type js/Function
IFoo (foo [this] (println "Hello from IFoo.foo for js/Function")))

;; extending a js base type
(extend-type number
IFoo (foo [this] (println "Hello from IFoo.foo for number")))
~~~

### How did we make KLIPSE?

[viebel][viebel-url] build KLIPSE (<span class="icon icon--github">{% include icon-github.svg %}</span> [github][github-url]) with [Om.next][om.next-url] and [CodeMirror][codemirror-url].

The [tutorial][tuto-url] propose a step by step tutorial to explain how to build the same app.

Now, feel free to fork and contribute to [klipse][github-url], you can find some TODOs in the readme.

### What is the future of KLIPSE?

Join the github project and you'll know: [contribution][contribution-url]

### What is the meaning of the name KLIPSE?

We prefer to leave it as a riddle :)
