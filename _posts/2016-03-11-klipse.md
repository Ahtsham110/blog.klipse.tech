### What is KLIPSE?

[KLIPSE][app-url] is a simple and elegant online cljs compiler and evaluator.


It looks like this:

![KLIPSE Screenshot](/assets/hello_klipse.png)

Basically, [KLIPSE][app-url] is made of 4 rectangles:

1. Top left rectangle: you insert your cljs code
2. Top right rectangle: you see the generated javascript code from the cljs code
3. Bottom left rectangle: you see the evaluation of the cljs code as a clojure object
4. Bottom right rectangle: you see the evaluation of the cljs code as a js object

Now, go ahead an play with it below: For instance type **(map inc [1 2 3])** and press Ctlr-Enter.

### Why we are passionate about KLIPSE?

Like the whole clojurescript community, we were excited when David Nolen [published][cljs-next-url] on July 29, 2015:

>ClojureScript can compile itself.



[KLIPSE][app-url] allows you to understand better how clojure and clojurescript works.

First, you can play with it and use it a (very simplistic) REPL.

But the real value of KLIPSE is that it shows you what happens behind the scene in clojurescript: it shows you the **js generated code**.
It shows you the magic that kind of allows LISP/SCHEME to be available in the browser, as it was envisioned in 1995 by the javascript inventor [Brendan Eich][brendan-eich-url] to 

>put scheme in the  browser.

Reading, observing and admiring the js generated code by cljs should really be a source of bliss for us the cljs developers community.

The trigger for developing KLIPSE was [this discussion][discussion-url] where Shaun Lebron shed light on the `extend-type` mechanism in cljs. He wrote this [gist][gist-url] that demonstrates the different behaviour of `extend-type` for cljs objects, js objects and js base types. The bottom line is:

> `extend-type` adds protocol methods to the type object's prototype  except for JS base types (e.g. "function", "number", "array").

With [KLIPSE][app-url], you can see it live by yourself (no need for a gist) + you can modify the cljs code and see how it effects the generated js.

So go ahead give it a try and execute Shaun's code on [KLIPSE][app-url]:

~~~ clojure
(defprotocol IFoo
(foo [this]))

;; dummy cljs type
(deftype Bar [])

;; extending a cljs type
(extend-type Bar
IFoo (foo [this] (println "Hello from IFoo.foo for Bar")))

;; extending a js type
(extend-type js/Function
IFoo (foo [this] (println "Hello from IFoo.foo for js/Function")))

;; extending a js base type
(extend-type number
IFoo (foo [this] (println "Hello from IFoo.foo for number")))
~~~

We, [viebel][viebel-url] and [raphaelboukara][rafi-url], built KLIPSE (<span class="icon icon--github">{% include icon-github.svg %}</span> [github][github-url]) with [Om.next][om.next-url] and [CodeMirror][codemirror-url].

This [article][tuto-url] contains a step by step tutorial that explains how to build the same app.

Now, feel free to fork and contribute to [klipse][github-url], you can find some TODOs in the readme.

### What is the future of KLIPSE?

### What is the meaning of the name KLIPSE?

We prefer to leave it as a riddle :)
