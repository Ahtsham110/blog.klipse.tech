### What is KLIPSE?

[KLIPSE][app-url] is a clojurescript evaluator that shows you 3 things about a cljs expression:

1. the result of its evaluation as a clojure object
2. its generated javascript code
3. the result of its evaluation as a js object

### Why we are passionate about KLIPSE?

Like the whole clojurescript community, we were excited when David Nolen [published][cljs-next-url] on July 29, 2015:

>ClojureScript can compile itself.



[KLIPSE][app-url] allows you to understand better how clojure and clojurescript works.

First, you can play with it and use it a (very simplistic) REPL.

But the real value of KLIPSE is that it shows you what happens behind the scene, what is the magic that kind of allows LISP to be available in the browser, as it was envisioned in 1995 by the javascript inventor [Brendan Eich][brendan-eich-url] to 

>put scheme in the  browser.

Reading, observing and admiring the js generated code by cljs should really be a source of bliss for us the cljs developers community.

The trigger for developing KLIPSE was [this discussion][discussion-url] where Shaun Lebron shed light on the `extend-type` mechanism in cljs. He wrote this [gist][gist-url] that demonstrates the different behaviour of `extend-type` for cljs objects, js objects and js base types. The bottom line is:

> `extend-type` adds protocol methods to the type object's prototype  except for JS base types (e.g. "function", "number", "array").

With [KLIPSE][app-url], you can see it live by yourself (no need for a gist) + you can modify the cljs code and see how it effects the generated js.

So go ahead give it a try and execute Shaun's code on [KLIPSE][app-url]:

~~~ clojure
(defprotocol IFoo
(foo [this]))

;; dummy cljs type
(deftype Bar [])

;; extending a cljs type
(extend-type Bar
IFoo (foo [this] (println "Hello from IFoo.foo for Bar")))

;; extending a js type
(extend-type js/Function
IFoo (foo [this] (println "Hello from IFoo.foo for js/Function")))

;; extending a js base type
(extend-type number
IFoo (foo [this] (println "Hello from IFoo.foo for number")))
~~~

### How did we make KLIPSE?

We, [viebel][viebel-url] and [raphaelboukara][rafi-url], built KLIPSE (<span class="icon icon--github">{% include icon-github.svg %}</span> [github][github-url]) with [Om.next][om.next-url] and [CodeMirror][codemirror-url].

This [article][tuto-url] proposes a step by step tutorial to explain how to build the same app.

Now, feel free to fork and contribute to [klipse][github-url], you can find some TODOs in the readme.

### What is the future of KLIPSE?

Join the github project and you'll know: [contribution][contribution-url]

### What is the meaning of the name KLIPSE?

We prefer to leave it as a riddle :)
