This blog post is about to show a new way of blogging about `C++`.

Look at a typical blog post about `C++`: The post usually presents a couple of code snippets. As I see it, there are two pains with code snippets:

1. they contain the input and the output but not the actual evaluation of the input
2. it's impossible for the reader to modify the output

# The forgotten dream

A long time ago, all the developers had a common dream. The dream was about interactivity, liveness, evaluation...

But we put this dream aside - because the browser understands only `javascript`.

And after a while, we even forgot that we ever had this dream.


Still, there are some people that didn't forget this dream, like Alan Kay:

>Question: Well, look at Wikipedia â€” it's a tremendous collaboration.

>Alan Kay: It is, but go to the article on [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)), can you write and execute Logo programs? Are there examples? No. The Wikipedia people didn't even imagine that, in spite of the fact that they're on a computer.

Here is the [full interview of Alan Kay](http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/interview-with-alan-kay/240003442?pgno=2){:target="_blank"}. (Thanks [@fasihsignal](https://twitter.com/fasihsignal) for bringing this quote to our awareness.)

# The klipse plugin

The klipse plugin is a small step toward Alan Kay's vision: it is a `javascript` tag that transforms static `C++` code snippets of an html page to live and interactive snippets:

1. **Live**: The code is executed in your browser
2. **Interactive**: You can modify the code and it is evaluated as you type

[Klipse](https://github.com/viebel/klipse) is written in `clojurescript`, and uses [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/) for text editing and [JSCPP](https://github.com/felixhao28/JSCPP) for the code evaluation. 


# Klipsify a C++ code snippet

Let's have on this page a static code snippet with a **Hello World** program in `C++`:
 
~~~c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
  return 0;
}
~~~

(This blog is written with `jekyll`: the `kramdown` plugin helps a lot in beautifying the code snippets.)

And now, we are going to **klipsify** this code snippet:

~~~klipse-cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
  return 0;
}
~~~

Feel free to edit the code above: it's interactive => it evaluates as you type.

All I had to do in order to **klipsify** my code snippet, was to set the `language-klipse-cpp` class (configurable) to the appropriate html element.

See it by yourself: here is the source of this page:

~~~html
<p>And now, we are going to <strong>klipsify</strong> this code snippet:</p>

<pre><code class="language-klipse-cpp">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
int main() {
  cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World!" &lt;&lt; endl;
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>
~~~


# Live demo

Before dealing about integration of the klipse plugin on a web page, let's enjoy another klipse snippet with a `C++` program that prints the system time in seconds:

~~~klipse-cpp
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  const double sysTime = time(0);
  cout << "System Time in seconds is: " << sysTime << "." << endl;
  return 0;
}
~~~

Go ahead! modify the klipse snippet above, and it will evaluate as you type...


# Evaluating a gist

We can also evaluate code from a `gist`.

For instance, let's klipsify [this gist](https://gist.github.com/viebel/cbd1cf8dce1ee99180285011b2a9753b) that prints the Fibonacci sequence using [Matrix Exponentiation](https://ronzii.wordpress.com/2011/07/09/using-matrix-exponentiation-to-calculated-nth-fibonacci-number/).

<pre>
<div class="language-klipse-cpp" data-gist-id="viebel/cbd1cf8dce1ee99180285011b2a9753b"></div>
</pre>

Again, enjoy the interactivity and modify the code...

# Evaluating a snippet in a loop

We can evaluate a code snippet in a loop by setting the `data-loop-msec` attribute of the DOM element containing the code snippet.

As an example, let's evaluate in a loop our previous code snippet that prints the system time with `data-loop-msec=1000`:

<pre><code class="language-klipse-cpp" data-loop-msec="1000">
#include &lt;ctime&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  const double sysTime = time(0);
  cout &lt;&lt;  sysTime;
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

As you can see, the time is printed in a loop every 1000 msec.


# Klipse plugin integration

All you need to do in order to integrate the klipse plugin to your blog (or any other web page), is to add this `javascript` tag to your web page:

~~~html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://storage.googleapis.com/app.klipse.tech/css/codemirror.css">

<script>
    window.klipse_settings = {
        selector_eval_cpp: '.language-klipse-cpp', // css selector for the html elements you want to klipsify
    };
</script>
<script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/app.klipse.tech/plugin_prod/js/klipse_plugin.min.js"></script>
~~~

By the way, this is exactly what we did on the page that you are currently reading.

# Limitations

For the moment, JSCPP provides a [partial implementation](https://github.com/felixhao28/JSCPP#which-features-are-implemented) of `C++`. But I'm sure that with the increase of the community interest, eventually `C++` will be fully implemented.

# Other languages

The klipse plugin is designed as a platform that could support any language that has a client-side evaluator, by writing modules to the klipse plugin. Currently, there are modules available for the following languages:
