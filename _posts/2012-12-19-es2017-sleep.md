Take a look at this piece of `javascript` code that runs live in your browser:

<pre><code class="language-es2017" data-async-code="true" data-eval-idle-msec="3000">
async function sleep(ms = 0) {
      return new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms));
}

async function run() {
      console.log("Before: " + (new Date()).toString());
      await sleep(3000);
      console.log("After:  " + (new Date()).toString());
}

run();
</code></pre>


Have you noticed something special?

It calls a `javascript` function named `sleep` that actually sleeps without using any callbacks.

[async](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) and [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await) are part of `EcmaScript 2017` and are supported only in `Chrome 55`, `Firefox 52.0` and `Opera 42`.

But even if you are currently in a different browser, the above code snippet runs fine because it is transpiled with [Babel Standalone](https://github.com/babel/babel-standalone).

Go ahead, play with this code snippet, modify it as you wish and it will be reevaluated after 3 seconds of inactivity (or by pressing `Ctrl-Enter`).

This **interactive** code snippet is powered by a tool of mine: the [klipse plugin](https://github.com/viebel/klipse). If you like it, I'd really appreciate your [star on github](https://github.com/viebel/klipse/stargazers).
