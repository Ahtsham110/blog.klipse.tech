What is going to be the output about this javascript snippet?

Will the `Now` be printed before of after the `After`?

(If you are not familiar with `await` and `async`, you might need to read about it: 
[async](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) and [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await).)

~~~javascript
async function sleep(ms = 0) {
      return new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms));
}

async function run() {
      console.log("Before: " + (new Date()).toString());
      await sleep(3000);
      console.log("After:  " + (new Date()).toString());
}

run();
console.log("Now:  " + (new Date()).toString());
~~~

It's a bit confusing because this piece of code look like a synchronous code: no callback appears in the code. But in fact, it is asynchronous. 

Order of message is tough - like one smart guy put it on twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There are only two hard problems in distributed systems:  2. Exactly-once delivery 1. Guaranteed order of messages 2. Exactly-once delivery</p>&mdash; Mathias Verraes (@mathiasverraes) <a href="https://twitter.com/mathiasverraes/status/632260618599403520">August 14, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


Now, let's run the code and check if you got it right: 

<pre><code class="language-es2017" data-async-code="true" data-eval-idle-msec="3000">
async function sleep(ms = 0) {
      return new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms));
}

async function run() {
      console.log("Before: " + (new Date()).toString());
      await sleep(3000);
      console.log("After:  " + (new Date()).toString());
}

run();
console.log("Now:  " + (new Date()).toString());
</code></pre>


Have you git it right?


[async](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) and [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await) are part of `EcmaScript 2017` and are supported only in `Chrome 55`, `Firefox 52.0` and `Opera 42`.

They are supposed to make our javascript code much more readable and our coding experience more fun.

Even if you are currently in a different browser, the above code snippet runs fine because it is transpiled with [Babel Standalone](https://github.com/babel/babel-standalone).

Go ahead, play with this code snippet, modify it as you wish and it will be reevaluated after 3 seconds of inactivity (or by pressing `Ctrl-Enter`).

This **interactive** code snippet is powered by a tool of mine: the [klipse plugin](https://github.com/viebel/klipse). If you like it, I'd really appreciate your [star on github](https://github.com/viebel/klipse/stargazers).
