### In Clojure, the language itself is modifiable

In `clojure`, the developer and the author of the language have a very intimate relationship: almost every part of the language author is extensible and modifiable by the `clojure` developer. 

It is well known that `macros` allow the developer to add new semantics to the language - as if they were an original part of the language.

But what about functions?

Functions as a concept is at the core of `clojure` (like for any other functional programming language). So it's not obvious to imagine that any kind of extensibility will be provided also for the concept of function.

I felt completely enlightened when I discovered - after a couple of months of `clojure` programming - that:

### Keywords and maps as functions: how does it work?

You probably already know that keywords and maps could be used as functions.

Let's see it in action with [KLIPSE][app-url]{:target="_blank"}:

Now, let's see what happens behind the scenes...

We will see that the mechanism that enables keywords and maps to behave like function is completely open and extensible.

Let's have a look at an excerpt from `clojurescript` [source code](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/blob/master/src/main/cljs/cljs/core.cljs#L435){:target="_blank"} to understand this mechanism.

Don't be afraid by the big pyramid...

  ([1 2 3 4] 1) => 2"
  (-invoke

    [this a]
    [this a b]
    [this a b c]
    [this a b c d]
    [this a b c d e]

    [this a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s]
    [this a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t]
    [this a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t rest]))

(deftype Keyword [...]
  ...
    IFn
    (-invoke [kw coll]
      (get coll kw))
    (-invoke [kw coll not-found]
      (get coll kw not-found))
...
)

(deftype PersistentHashMap [...]
...
  IFn
  (-invoke [coll k]
    (-lookup coll k))

  (-invoke [coll k not-found]
    (-lookup coll k not-found))
...
)

What an amazing discovery: 

> `clojurescript` exposes its most basic element - **the function** - as a protocol!!!

Keywords and maps behave like functions simply because they implement the `-invoke` method of `IFn` protocol.

And you - as a `clojurescript` developer - are not limited to the types that implement the `IFn` protocol. The reason is that in `clojurescript` every protocol can be extended through `extend-type` and `extend-protocol` after the `type` is defined. 


We will see now  how simple it is to make strings behave like functions.

From this below, we are dealing with hacky stuff. The objective of this article is to illustrate advanced feature of the language and I definitely discourage you to deal with that hacky stuff on production code.

David Nolen stated it this way in a interesting discussion with me on [clojurians Slack](https://clojurians.slack.com/){:target="_blank"}:

> "Extending base types is really about convenience, expressivity - no way at the moment for it to be performant" - David Nolen.

### Strings as functions: Home brew
Let's see how to make strings behave like functions using `extend-type` and implementing `-invoke` in a similar way that it was done for keywords in `clojurescript` source code:

</iframe>

For some technical reason (see [CLJS-1618](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJS-1618){:target="_blank"}), we have to wrap the string into `str`. But beside that, it is really simple.


Also, this extensibility for base types is not available in `clojure`. The reason is that in `clojure` only types that are defined in `clojure` can be extended to `java` interfaces. And `IFn` is a `java` interface and the base types (strings, numbers, regexps, maps,etc..) are defined in `java`.

### Regular expressions as functions: Home brew

Now, let's see how to do fancy stuff with regular expressions.

Instead of having to write this:

1. `(re-find re s)` to check if a string matches a regular expression
2. `(clojure.string/replace s match replacement)` to do string replacements

We will show what to do in order to be able to write that:

1. `(re s)` to check if a string matches a regular expression
2. `(match replacement s)` to do string replacements

`Clojurescript` extensibility allowed us to create new type of functions with a few lines of (simple) code...

Don't you feel enlightened?

Like I said above, dealing with base types is really dangerous. So, please be careful...

If you have any ideas about implementing `IFn` protocol for custom types, I'd really appreciate if you share it in the comments below.

Clojurescript rocks!
