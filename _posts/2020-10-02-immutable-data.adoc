== The principle in a nutshell

[quote]
Principle #2: Model the data part of the entities of your application using generic data structures (mostly maps and arrays).


== Remarks on Principle #2


== Illustration of Principle #1

==  Benefits

*** Generic functions
*** Flexible data model
*** Code is less verbose
*** Serialization for free

== Price

*** Data shape needs to be documented manually
*** No compile time check that the data is valid
*** Less structure
