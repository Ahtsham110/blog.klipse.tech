## Power of expression vs. Performances

`map` and `reduce` are the basic building blocks of functional programming.

The essence of `map` and `reduce` is that they give you - the developer - more power of expression over the equivalent piece of code using a `while` or a `for` loop.

And the power of expression is an important part of SW development.

But very often, there is a trade-off between power of expression and performances.
It's the case with `reduce` in `javascript`.
But, fortunately, `Clojurescript` comes to the rescue with its **super-powerful macros** and we - the clojurescript developers - enjoy both high performances an the power of expression.

In this article, we show illustrate this idea dealing with a function that calculates the sum of the squares of an array of numbers.

## javascript: reduce vs. for loop

Let's compare the performances of `reduce` and `for` for `sum-of-squares`, with [KLIPSE][app-url-js]{:target="_blank"}.

In this article, we are going to mix `clojurescript` and `javascript` interactive code snippets.

All the code snippets of this page are **live** and **interactive** powered by the [klipse plugin](https://github.com/viebel/klipse):

1. **Live**: The code is executed in your browser
2. **Interactive**: You can modify the code and it is evaluated as you type


First, the `reduce` implementation:

~~~klipse-eval-js
function sum_of_squares_reduce_js(arr) {
        return arr.reduce(function(res, val) {
                    return res + val * val;
                        }, 0);
}
sum_of_squares_reduce_js([1,2,3])
~~~

And the `for loop` implementation:

~~~klipse-eval-js
function sum_of_squares_for_js(arr) {
      var res=0;
        for(var i=0; i < arr.length; i++){
                res = res + arr[i] * arr[i];
                  }
                    return res;
}
sum_of_squares_for_js([1,2,3])
~~~

Now, let's compare the performances of `reduce` vs. `for`:

~~~klipse
(def n 1000000)
(def js-arr (to-array (range n)))

(time (js/sum_of_squares_reduce_js js-arr))
(time (js/sum_of_squares_for_js js-arr))
~~~

> In `javascript` (at least in Chrome on August 2016), `reduce` is much slower than `for`.

Feel free to modify `js-arr` to benchmark as you wish.

Someone wrote in the comments that on Firefox, `reduce` is faster than `for`.

If you are on another browser, please write in the comments what are the performances on your browser....


## Clojurescript areduce

In `clojurescript` there is a handy way to reduce over native arrays.

Please welcome [areduce](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/areduce){:target="_blank"}.

With `areduce` you pass an expression instead of a function

~~~clojure
(areduce a idx ret init expr)
~~~
> `areduce` reduces an expression across an array `a`, using an index named `idx`, and return value named `ret`, initialized to `init`, setting `ret` to the evaluation of `expr` at each step, returning `ret`.

Obviously, `areduce` is a macro.

It sounds complex, but with an example it will be very clear.
Let's implement our sum of squares using `areduce` and have a look at the transpiled `javascript` code:

~~~klipse-js
(defn sum-of-squares-clj-areduce [xs]
  (areduce xs i ret 0
             (+ ret (* (aget xs i) (aget xs i)))))
~~~

Observe the transpiled `javascript` code: It's very close to the implementation, you'd have written for `sum-of-squares`, before `reduce` was available in `javascript`.
(Maybe you'd chosen better names for the variables.)

From the power of expression perspective, `areduce` is as powerful are `reduce`.

We will investigate the performance of `areduce` in the next paragraph.


## Clojurescript areduce vs. Javascript reduce

Now, it's obvious why `areduce` is faster that `javascript`'s `reduce`: `areduce` is a macro that allows you - the developer - to write elegant code that is translated at compile time to fast native code.


Let's see it in action with [KLIPSE][app-url-js]{:target="_blank"}.

~~~klipse
(defn sum-of-squares-clj-areduce [xs]
  (areduce xs i ret 0
             (+ ret (* (aget xs i) (aget xs i)))))

(time (sum-of-squares-clj-areduce js-arr))
~~~


> In `clojurescript`, `areduce` is as fast as `for` in `javascript`



Clojurescript rocks!
